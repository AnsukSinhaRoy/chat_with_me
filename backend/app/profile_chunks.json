I have put in efforts so that it is very easy to study and reproduce the results that are obtained. The configurations are stored in a YAML file. The results are visualized using dashboards built with streamlit, and its also hosted online. There are deep dive sections that look into metrics like drawdown, sharpe ratio to compare the algorithm performance. This is related to my masters thesis work on online portfolio optimization."

The model was used to predict the statistical performance of the asset, and accordingly take decisions. We became the finalists of the hackathon. It was a great introduction into the world of Deep Learning and algorithmic trading."

    "text": "I have been a curious kid since the beginning, with interest in coding. I remember, the first program that I wrote and was very proud of, was when I built an MD5 decryption tool in Java, I was in class 12, and inspired by Kevin Mitnick (renouned hacker). I did my B.tech in computer science from UEM Kolkata, where I got into competitive programming and building small projects. I did an internship at Relate infotech as a Full stack developer, but quickly realised that i wanted to study more about AI/ML. So I prepared for masters and got into IIT Dhanbad for M.tech in electronics engineering. Here I got the exposure to the Mathematics like Linear Algebra, Probability and Optimization that is required for doing research in AI/ML. Then I luckily got an internship at Nokia Standards, where I am working with colleagues from Bell Labs and implementing Deep Reinforcement Learning to perform optimization in Physical Layer resource allocation problem. I look forward to continue my journey in AI/ML research, and gain industry experience in this field"

    "id": "superpower",
    "title": "Common question: #1 superpower",
    "text": "If I have to pick one, then it has to be the fact that I put all my heart into whatever I do. For example, this small chat bot that I have built and you are talking to, has something like a mini-RAG implementration under the hood. Another example is my Nokia's internship. I was mainly given the task to look into the finetuning aspect of the q-network model, but I went a step forward to change the core aspects of the algorithm - moving into a more complex memory sampling technique, which increased the performance of the model by a good extent. All in all, I think my superpower is my dedication towards my work."

    "text": "A common misconception is that I am into application of ML only, but I actually love to understand the core mathematical aspect of it as well. For example, during my masters, I have taken courses like Convex Optimization, Stochastic Processes and Time Series Analysis, which are very math-heavy courses. I love to understand the core concepts behind the algorithms, and not just use them as black boxes."

  {
    "id": "push_limits",
    "title": "Common question: how I push limits",
    "text": "I push my limits by choosing problems that are slightly above my current skill level and then forcing clarity through experiments. I don’t trust “it works”—I trust ablations, baselines, and repeatable runs. When I hit a wall, I zoom out, learn the missing math or systems detail, and come back with a cleaner approach. Basically: I stress-test my ideas until they either survive—or teach me something."
